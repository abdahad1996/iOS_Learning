### **Complexity of Nested Contexts in Core Data**

Nested contexts introduce a new layer of complexity to Core Data, allowing parent-child relationships between managed object contexts (MOCs). While this can offer powerful features for certain scenarios (e.g., deferred saves, temporary edits), it also brings potential pitfalls, especially when used beyond their core use cases. Let’s explore these complexities in detail.

---

### **Nested Contexts Overview**

1. **Parent-Child Relationship**:
   - A child context pushes its changes to the parent context upon saving.
   - The parent context must save its own changes to persist them to the persistent store.

2. **Scenarios Where Nested Contexts Shine**:
   - **Deferred Saves**: A main context as a child of a private background context defers expensive I/O operations, reducing UI blocking.
   - **Scratchpads**: Child contexts allow temporary edits that can be discarded or saved to the parent.

3. **Complex Setups**:
   - Nested contexts are not designed to replace traditional setups like multiple independent contexts connected to a shared persistent store coordinator.
   - Introducing deeply nested or mixed contexts often leads to unintended behaviors and increased code complexity.

### **Issues with Nested Contexts**

#### **1. Blocking Behavior with Deeply Nested Contexts**
In setups where multiple nested contexts are chained together (e.g., a private child context for background tasks), each fetch request or fault fulfillment in the child context can block the UI if the parent context is on the main queue.

**Example of Problematic Setup**:
```plaintext
Private Queue Context (Background Tasks)
Main Queue Context (UI)
Private Queue Context (Background Tasks)
Persistent Store Coordinator
Persistent Store
SQLite
```

**Issues**:
- Any operation in the bottom-most private queue context must propagate through the parent contexts to the persistent store coordinator.
- Fetch requests or fault fulfillment in the private child context block the main queue.

**Alternative Recommendation**:
- Use independent contexts connected to the persistent store coordinator rather than deeply nested contexts.

---

#### **2. Forced Propagation of Changes**
When saving a nested private context, all changes must propagate to the parent context. Unlike independent contexts where merging changes is explicit, nested contexts automatically push changes up the chain.

**Issues**:
- Every save in the child context immediately affects the parent context, even if the changes are irrelevant to the parent’s current state.
- The main context may frequently update, potentially impacting UI responsiveness.

**Example**:
In a deeply nested setup:
1. Changes in a private background context are saved.
2. These changes propagate to the main context (parent).
3. The main context must then save again to persist changes to the persistent store.

---

#### **3. Loss of Fine-Grained Conflict Resolution**
Conflict resolution policies are less flexible with nested contexts:
- In traditional setups, you can specify merge policies (e.g., `mergeByPropertyObjectTrump`).
- With nested contexts, saving a child context overwrites the parent context’s data without using merge policies.

**Result**:
Conflicts between the child and parent contexts are harder to manage and may result in unexpected behavior.

### **Temporary and Permanent Object IDs**

#### **How Object IDs Work Without Nested Contexts**
- New objects initially have **temporary IDs**.
- After saving to the persistent store, Core Data assigns **permanent IDs**.
- Permanent IDs are unique and can be used across all contexts connected to the same persistent store coordinator.

#### **How Nested Contexts Affect Object IDs**
- Objects in a child context retain their **temporary IDs**, even after saving the child context.
- Only objects saved to the persistent store (via the root context) receive permanent IDs.

**Key Problems**:
1. **Scope of Temporary IDs**:
   - Temporary IDs are only valid in the originating child context and its parent hierarchy.
   - Attempting to use a temporary ID outside this scope results in crashes.

2. **Breaking Core Data's Uniquing Guarantees**:
   - If you pass a temporary ID to a child context, Core Data may create multiple object instances for the same data.
   - Modifying both instances leads to data conflicts during saves.

**Example**:
```swift
let childContext = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .mainQueueConcurrencyType)
childContext.parent = mainContext

// Create a new object in the child context
let newObject = MyEntity(context: childContext)

// Attempt to use the temporary ID in the main context
let objectID = newObject.objectID
let fetchedObject = mainContext.object(with: objectID) // Crash if ID is temporary
```

**Solution**:
Before passing object IDs to another context, convert them to permanent IDs using:
```swift
try childContext.obtainPermanentIDs(for: [newObject])
```

### **Mixing Nested and Independent Contexts**

#### **Scenario**:
You combine nested contexts (for deferred saves) with independent contexts (for background imports).

**Setup**:
```plaintext
Main Queue Context (Child)
Private Queue Context (Parent)
Private Queue Context (Independent)
Persistent Store Coordinator
Persistent Store
SQLite
```

**Issues**:
1. **Merging Changes**:
   - Changes saved in the independent context must propagate to both the parent and child contexts of the nested setup.
   - The main context may still reflect outdated data due to reliance on its parent context for updates.

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Independent contexts may update the same objects as nested contexts.
   - Parent context saves can fail or merge conflicting changes, leaving the main context unaware of the failure or resolution.

**Solution**:
On iOS 9/macOS 10.11 or later, use `mergeChanges(fromRemoteContextSave:into:)` to merge changes into nested contexts:
```swift
let notification: [AnyHashable: Any] = [
    NSUpdatedObjectsKey: updatedObjects,
    NSInsertedObjectsKey: insertedObjects
]
NSManagedObjectContext.mergeChanges(fromRemoteContextSave: notification, into: [parentContext, mainContext])
```

For earlier versions, merge manually:
1. Merge changes into the parent context first.
2. Refresh updated objects in the parent context before merging into the child context.

### **Best Practices for Nested Contexts**

1. **Use Nested Contexts Only When Necessary**:
   - Reserve for deferred saves or temporary edits (scratchpads).

2. **Minimize Context Depth**:
   - Avoid deeply nested hierarchies. Stick to a single child context for most use cases.

3. **Handle Temporary IDs Carefully**:
   - Obtain permanent IDs before passing objects between contexts.

4. **Prefer Simplicity**:
   - Use independent contexts connected to the persistent store coordinator whenever possible.

5. **Manage Conflict Resolution**:
   - Test merge policies thoroughly to handle data conflicts effectively.

---

### **Conclusion**

Nested contexts in Core Data are powerful but introduce significant complexity. They:
- Can block the UI if misused.
- Automatically propagate changes, which might not always be desirable.
- Complicate object ID management and conflict resolution.

To mitigate these issues:
- Limit their use to appropriate scenarios like deferred saves and scratchpads.
- Avoid deep nesting or mixing with independent contexts unless absolutely necessary.

For most use cases, simpler setups with independent contexts connected to a shared persistent store coordinator are easier to manage and debug.
