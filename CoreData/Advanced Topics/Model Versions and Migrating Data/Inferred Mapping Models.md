### **Inferred Mapping Models in Core Data: A Detailed Explanation**

Core Data's **inferred mapping models** allow for seamless migrations when the changes between data model versions are straightforward. This process is part of **lightweight migration**, where Core Data can infer how to map the old schema to the new schema automatically.

---

### **What Are Inferred Mapping Models?**

Inferred mapping models are automatically generated by Core Data based on the differences between two model versions. They define how entities, attributes, and relationships from one model map to another, ensuring data compatibility without requiring explicit mapping models for simple changes.

---

### **Changes Supported by Inferred Mapping Models**

Core Data can handle the following changes with inferred mapping models:

1. **Attributes**:
   - Adding, removing, and renaming attributes.
   - Changing an attribute from **optional** to **non-optional** (requires a default value).

2. **Relationships**:
   - Adding, removing, and renaming relationships.

3. **Entities**:
   - Adding, removing, and renaming entities.

4. **Indexes**:
   - Adding, removing, or changing **indexes** on attributes.
   - Adding, removing, or changing **compound indexes** on entities.

5. **Unique Constraints**:
   - Adding, removing, or modifying **unique constraints**.

---

### **Important Gotchas and Tips**

#### **1. Changing Optional to Non-Optional Attributes**
When making an attribute non-optional, you must specify a default value in the model editor. Otherwise, Core Data cannot infer how to handle existing records where the attribute is `nil`.

#### **2. Index Changes Are Not Automatically Detected**
If you modify indexes (e.g., add or change them), Core Data won’t detect this as a model change by default. To ensure migration occurs, set a **hash modifier** for the affected attribute or entity in the data model inspector. The hash modifier is a custom string that forces Core Data to consider these changes.

#### **3. Renaming Attributes and Entities**
When renaming, you must use the **Renaming ID** field in the data model inspector. The Renaming ID specifies the original name of the attribute/entity in the previous model version, allowing Core Data to link the old name to the new one.

- **Example**:
   - **Version 1**: `remoteIdentifier` is renamed to `remoteID` in **Version 2**.
   - In **Version 2**, set the **Renaming ID** of `remoteID` to `remoteIdentifier`.

   If you rename the property again in **Version 3**, set the **Renaming ID** in **Version 3** to `remoteID` (from **Version 2**).

### **Using Inferred Mapping Models**

#### **Automatic Migration**
When using automatic migration, Core Data infers the mapping model without additional effort. For instance, if you enable lightweight migrations by setting `NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption` to `true`, Core Data will automatically:
1. Detect the old model version.
2. Create an inferred mapping model.
3. Migrate the data.

#### **Manual Migration**
You can still leverage inferred mapping models in manual migrations by creating them explicitly with the `NSMappingModel.inferredMappingModel(forSourceModel:destinationModel:)` method.

---

### **How to Create an Inferred Mapping Model**

The `NSMappingModel` class provides the method:
```swift
NSMappingModel.inferredMappingModel(forSourceModel:destinationModel:)
```
This method generates a mapping model based on the differences between two versions.

#### **Example Code**
Here’s how you might implement this in a project:
```swift
extension Version: ModelVersion {
    func mappingModelsToSuccessor() -> [NSMappingModel]? {
        switch self {
        case .version1:
            // Attempt to infer the mapping model between version 1 and its successor
            let mapping = try! NSMappingModel.inferredMappingModel(
                forSourceModel: managedObjectModel(),
                destinationModel: successor!.managedObjectModel()
            )
            return [mapping]
        // Add cases for other versions if necessary
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }
}
```

In this code:
- The method `inferredMappingModel(forSourceModel:destinationModel:)` creates the inferred mapping model.
- The `try!` statement ensures that the app crashes immediately if Core Data cannot infer the mapping model, indicating a programming error.

### **Lightweight Migration Example**

Suppose you have a **Person** entity with the following changes:
1. Added a new optional attribute: `middleName`.
2. Renamed `lastName` to `surname`.
3. Added an index to `firstName`.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create a New Model Version**:
   - In Xcode, select **Editor > Add Model Version** and make changes in the new version.

2. **Set Renaming IDs**:
   - In the new model version, set the **Renaming ID** of `surname` to `lastName`.

3. **Enable Lightweight Migration**:
   - If using `NSPersistentContainer`:
     ```swift
     let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "MyApp")
     container.loadPersistentStores { storeDescription, error in
         if let error = error as NSError? {
             fatalError("Unresolved error \(error), \(error.userInfo)")
         }
     }
     ```
   - If using `addPersistentStore`:
     ```swift
     let options: [String: Any] = [
         NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption: true,
         NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption: true
     ]
     try! persistentStoreCoordinator.addPersistentStore(
         ofType: NSSQLiteStoreType,
         configurationName: nil,
         at: storeURL,
         options: options
     )
     ```

4. **Core Data Infers the Mapping Model**:
   - The migration completes automatically without requiring a custom mapping model.

---

### **When Lightweight Migration Fails**

If Core Data cannot infer a mapping model, it will throw an error. This usually happens when:
- The changes are too complex (e.g., splitting an entity into two).
- A required `Renaming ID` is missing.

In such cases, you must create a **custom mapping model**.

---

### **Advantages of Inferred Mapping Models**
- **Simplicity**: No need to manually define mappings for simple changes.
- **Speed**: Lightweight migrations are much faster than full migrations.
- **Low Maintenance**: Less code to write and maintain.

---

### **Conclusion**

Inferred mapping models make Core Data migrations significantly easier for simple model changes like renaming, adding, or removing attributes/entities. By leveraging lightweight migrations, developers can avoid much of the complexity associated with manual migrations. However, it’s essential to understand the limitations and prepare for edge cases, such as ensuring proper `Renaming IDs` or handling more complex schema changes manually.
