### **Save Conflicts in Core Data (Detailed Explanation with Examples)**

When working with multiple managed object contexts (MOCs) simultaneously, **save conflicts** can occur. These conflicts arise when two contexts modify the same data and then attempt to save their changes. Core Data resolves such conflicts using **optimistic locking** and merge policies.

---

### **What is a Save Conflict?**

Imagine two users (or contexts) working on the same **"Employee"** object in your app. Both users load the object with a salary of `$5000` from the database. Here’s what happens:

1. **User A (Context A)**:
   - Updates the salary to `$5500`.
   - Saves the context.

2. **User B (Context B)**:
   - Updates the salary to `$5200`.
   - Tries to save the context **after User A has already saved.**

Now, User B’s context tries to save data based on an **outdated snapshot**, causing a **save conflict.**

---

### **How Does Core Data Handle Conflicts?**

Core Data detects conflicts when a context is saved. It uses **optimistic locking** to identify discrepancies between:
1. The **snapshot**: A context’s last known state of the object when it was fetched.
2. The **row cache**: The current state of the object in memory.
3. The **SQLite store**: The state of the object in the persistent database.

If discrepancies exist, Core Data uses a **merge policy** to resolve the conflict.

---

### **Optimistic Locking**

- **Optimistic locking** assumes that conflicts are rare and defers checking for conflicts until the context saves.
- Each managed object has a **version token** (or snapshot) that Core Data uses to compare the last known state with the current state in the persistent store.

#### Example:
1. **Snapshot in Context A**: `salary = $5000`
2. **Snapshot in Context B**: `salary = $5000`
3. **SQLite Store After Context A Saves**: `salary = $5500`
4. When Context B tries to save `salary = $5200`, Core Data detects the conflict using these snapshots.

---

### **Merge Policies**

Core Data provides **predefined merge policies** to resolve conflicts:

#### 1. **NSRollbackMergePolicy**
- Discards **in-memory changes** for objects that caused conflicts.
- Reverts the conflicting object to the state in the persistent store.

##### Example:
```swift
context.mergePolicy = NSRollbackMergePolicy
```

**Scenario**:
- Context A saves `salary = $5500`.
- Context B saves `salary = $5200`, causing a conflict.
- **Result**: Context B's changes are discarded, and the object reverts to `salary = $5500`.

---

#### 2. **NSOverwriteMergePolicy**
- Overwrites the persistent store with the **in-memory changes**, regardless of conflicts.

##### Example:
```swift
context.mergePolicy = NSOverwriteMergePolicy
```

**Scenario**:
- Context A saves `salary = $5500`.
- Context B saves `salary = $5200`, causing a conflict.
- **Result**: The database is updated to `salary = $5200`.

---

#### 3. **NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicy**
- Resolves conflicts **property by property**, prioritizing the **store's values**.

##### Example:
```swift
context.mergePolicy = NSMergeByPropertyStoreTrumpMergePolicy
```

**Scenario**:
- Context A saves:
  - `salary = $5500`
  - `position = "Manager"`
- Context B changes:
  - `salary = $5200`
  - `department = "HR"`

- **Result**:
  - `salary = $5500` (store prevails for salary).
  - `department = "HR"` (context prevails for department).

---

#### 4. **NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy**
- Resolves conflicts **property by property**, prioritizing the **context's values**.

##### Example:
```swift
context.mergePolicy = NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy
```

**Scenario**:
- Context A saves:
  - `salary = $5500`
  - `position = "Manager"`
- Context B changes:
  - `salary = $5200`
  - `department = "HR"`

- **Result**:
  - `salary = $5200` (context prevails for salary).
  - `position = "Manager"` (store prevails for position).

---

### **Default Behavior**

If no merge policy is specified, Core Data’s default is to throw an **`NSManagedObjectMergeError`** when a conflict occurs.

#### Handling the Error:
```swift
do {
    try context.save()
} catch let error as NSError {
    if error.domain == NSCocoaErrorDomain && error.code == NSManagedObjectMergeError {
        print("Save conflict detected: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

---

### **Custom Merge Policies**

For advanced use cases, you can create custom merge policies by subclassing `NSMergePolicy` and implementing your own conflict resolution logic.

#### Example:
```swift
class CustomMergePolicy: NSMergePolicy {
    override func resolve(constraintConflicts list: [NSConstraintConflict]) throws {
        for conflict in list {
            // Custom conflict resolution logic
            print("Conflict detected for object: \(conflict.object)")
        }
    }
}

context.mergePolicy = CustomMergePolicy(merge: .mergeByPropertyObjectTrump)
```

---

### **Practical Example**

Let’s simulate a **conflict** and resolve it with `NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy`.

#### Setup:
1. Create two contexts:
   ```swift
   let contextA = persistentContainer.newBackgroundContext()
   let contextB = persistentContainer.newBackgroundContext()
   ```

2. Fetch the same object in both contexts:
   ```swift
   let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<Employee> = Employee.fetchRequest()

   let employeeA = try contextA.fetch(fetchRequest).first!
   let employeeB = try contextB.fetch(fetchRequest).first!
   ```

3. Modify the object in both contexts:
   ```swift
   employeeA.salary = 5500
   employeeB.salary = 5200
   ```

4. Save Context A:
   ```swift
   try contextA.save() // Persists salary = 5500
   ```

5. Save Context B (Conflict Occurs):
   ```swift
   contextB.mergePolicy = NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy
   try contextB.save() // Persists salary = 5200
   ```

#### Result:
The conflict is resolved using the **object trump policy**, and the database ends up with `salary = 5200`.

### **Best Practices**

1. **Choose the Right Merge Policy**:
   - Use `NSRollbackMergePolicy` if the persistent store always has the correct data.
   - Use `NSOverwriteMergePolicy` if in-memory changes should always prevail.
   - Use property-based merge policies for more granular conflict resolution.

2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
   - Catch and log save errors.
   - Provide users with options to retry or discard changes.

3. **Test Concurrent Scenarios**:
   - Simulate multiple contexts modifying the same data to identify potential conflicts.

4. **Consider Context Merge**:
   - Use `mergeChanges(fromContextDidSave:)` to sync changes between contexts.

---

### **Summary**
- Save conflicts occur when multiple contexts modify the same data and attempt to save.
- Core Data uses optimistic locking and **snapshots** to detect conflicts.
- Resolve conflicts using predefined or custom **merge policies**.
- Plan ahead for conflict scenarios in apps with concurrent contexts.
