Sure! Let’s break down **Core Data's change tracking** in a super simple way, using examples so it's easy to understand. The idea is to help you see how Core Data keeps track of changes you make to data, like adding, deleting, or updating, and how it ensures everything stays in sync. 

---

## **What is Change Tracking in Core Data?**

Core Data tracks changes to objects in your app to manage the data efficiently and reliably. It’s like a diary where Core Data writes down:
1. **What changed?**
2. **How it changed?**
3. **When it changed?**

It keeps these notes at two levels:
1. Between **saves** (when changes are stored permanently in the database).
2. Between smaller updates (when Core Data processes temporary changes).

---

## **Change Tracking Between Saves**

Let’s say you’re building a Contacts app, and you have a **Person** object with properties like `name` and `phoneNumber`. You can:
- **Insert** a new contact.
- **Update** the phone number for an existing contact.
- **Delete** a contact.

### Example:

1. You create a new **Person**:
   ```swift
   let newPerson = Person(context: context)
   newPerson.name = "John Doe"
   newPerson.phoneNumber = "123-456-7890"
   ```
   Core Data tracks that this is a **newly inserted object**.

2. You update John’s phone number:
   ```swift
   newPerson.phoneNumber = "987-654-3210"
   ```
   Core Data marks it as an **updated object**.

3. You delete John:
   ```swift
   context.delete(newPerson)
   ```
   Core Data marks it as a **deleted object**.

Now, Core Data knows:
- An object was inserted (John).
- That same object was updated (phone number changed).
- The object was later deleted.

---

### **How Core Data Tracks These Changes**
Core Data maintains a **list of changes** between saves. When you call `context.save()`, it writes those changes to the database.

#### Key API:
- **Flags on Objects**:
  - `isInserted`: True for new objects.
  - `isUpdated`: True if any property was changed.
  - `isDeleted`: True if the object is marked for deletion.

#### Example:
```swift
if newPerson.isInserted {
    print("This is a new object.")
}
if newPerson.isUpdated {
    print("This object has been modified.")
}
if newPerson.isDeleted {
    print("This object is scheduled for deletion.")
}
```

## **Change Tracking Between Smaller Updates**

Before you save changes to the database, Core Data processes changes locally. This is useful to:
1. Keep your app responsive.
2. Make updates visible to other parts of your app (e.g., updating a table view).

### Example:
Imagine you’re displaying John’s details in a table view. When his phone number changes, the table view should update immediately.

1. You change the phone number:
   ```swift
   newPerson.phoneNumber = "555-555-5555"
   ```
   This triggers a **notification** (`NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange`) that tells your app something has changed.

2. Core Data sends out a message saying:
   - **This object has been updated.**
   - **Here are the properties that changed.**

---

### **How Core Data Handles Pending Changes**
Core Data uses the `processPendingChanges()` method to finalize temporary changes.

#### Example:

1. You add multiple changes:
   ```swift
   newPerson.name = "Jane Doe"
   newPerson.phoneNumber = "111-111-1111"
   ```
2. Core Data processes these changes behind the scenes and sends a notification:
   - "Hey, the `name` and `phoneNumber` for `Person` have changed."

#### Key Points:
- You don’t need to call `processPendingChanges()` yourself; Core Data does it automatically.
- You can listen for changes using **notifications**.

---

### **Listening for Changes**
To know what changed, you can listen for notifications.

#### Example:
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: .NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange,
    object: context,
    queue: nil
) { notification in
    if let updatedObjects = notification.userInfo?[NSUpdatedObjectsKey] as? Set<NSManagedObject> {
        for object in updatedObjects {
            print("Updated object: \(object)")
        }
    }
}
```

This notification tells you which objects were:
- Inserted.
- Updated.
- Deleted.

---

## **Checking What Changed**

Core Data lets you see what exactly changed:
- Use `changedValues` to get **new values** for updated properties.
- Use `committedValues(forKeys:)` to get **old values** before the change.

#### Example:
```swift
let changes = newPerson.changedValues
print("Changed properties: \(changes.keys)")
print("New values: \(changes)")
```

If you want to compare old and new values:
```swift
let oldValues = newPerson.committedValues(forKeys: nil)
print("Old values: \(oldValues)")
```

---

## **Undo Manager**

Core Data can also track changes for undo/redo functionality:
1. Every time you make a change, it registers an undo action.
2. If you undo, Core Data restores the previous state.

#### Example:
```swift
context.undoManager = UndoManager()
newPerson.name = "Jane Smith"
context.undo()
print(newPerson.name) // "John Doe"
```

---

## **Key Terms and Recap**

- **`hasChanges`**: The context or object has unsaved changes.
- **`isInserted`**: The object is new and unsaved.
- **`isUpdated`**: The object has modified properties.
- **`isDeleted`**: The object is marked for deletion.
- **`NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChange`**: Notification for changes in the context.
- **`processPendingChanges()`**: Finalizes temporary changes before saving.

---

## **Why Change Tracking is Important**
- Keeps track of changes before saving, so you can modify or undo them.
- Sends notifications to update the UI reactively.
- Helps avoid conflicts when saving data.

---

### **Final Example: Full Workflow**

1. Insert a new object:
   ```swift
   let person = Person(context: context)
   person.name = "Alice"
   print(person.isInserted) // true
   ```

2. Modify a property:
   ```swift
   person.name = "Alice Cooper"
   print(person.isUpdated) // true
   print(person.changedValues) // ["name": "Alice"]
   ```

3. Delete the object:
   ```swift
   context.delete(person)
   print(person.isDeleted) // true
   ```

4. Save changes:
   ```swift
   context.save()
   print(context.hasChanges) // false (all changes saved)
   ```
