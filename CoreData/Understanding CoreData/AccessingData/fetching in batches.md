### Detailed Explanation of Fetching in Batches in Core Data

**Core Data** is a powerful framework for managing an app's data model. However, when working with a large dataset, fetching and managing objects efficiently becomes crucial. This is where `fetchBatchSize` plays a significant role.

---

### **Understanding the Problem**
Imagine your app needs to display 100,000 objects in a table view. If you execute a standard fetch request, Core Data will:
1. Return an array of 100,000 objects (faults) â€” a lot of managed objects to instantiate in memory.
2. Load the raw data for all 100,000 rows into SQLite's row cache.

This approach is inefficient, as most of the objects may not be immediately visible or necessary. The result is significant memory overhead and performance issues.

### **What is `fetchBatchSize`?**
`fetchBatchSize` allows you to control how many objects Core Data fetches into memory at a time. Instead of loading all 100,000 objects at once, Core Data loads only a small batch (e.g., 20 objects) when you access them. This drastically reduces memory usage and improves performance.

### **How `fetchBatchSize` Works**

#### **Configuration Example**
```swift
let request = Mood.sortedFetchRequest(with: moodSource.predicate)
request.returnsObjectsAsFaults = false
request.fetchBatchSize = 20
```

#### **Execution Process**

1. **Primary Key Loading**:
   - Core Data loads all the **primary keys (object IDs)** from the database into memory. Predicates and sort descriptors are applied during this step, so the result is a filtered and sorted list of object IDs.
   - The returned result is an **array of object IDs**, not the full data for each object.

2. **Array Backed by Object IDs**:
   - The persistent store coordinator creates a special array backed by object IDs. This array acts as a placeholder. 
   - The count and order of elements are fixed, but the data for each object is not loaded yet. 
   - The array behaves like a promise: it will fetch the data only when required.

#### **Lazy Loading Process**
When you access an element of the array, Core Data fetches the data in batches:

1. **Batch Loading**:
   - The array detects that data for the requested object is missing. It asks the managed object context to fetch a batch of `fetchBatchSize` (e.g., 20) objects around the index you accessed.

2. **SQL Execution**:
   - This request is forwarded through the persistent store coordinator to the SQLite database.
   - The database executes a SQL query to fetch the batch's raw data. The raw data is stored in the **row cache**, and the corresponding managed objects are instantiated.

3. **Populating Data**:
   - If `returnsObjectsAsFaults` is set to `false`, Core Data populates the fetched objects with their full data instead of leaving them as faults.
   - The populated objects are returned to the context.

4. **Returning Objects**:
   - The batch array returns the object you requested and keeps the other objects in the same batch in memory, anticipating that you may need them next.

#### **Memory Management**:
- As you iterate through the array, Core Data fetches additional batches as needed.
- Batches are cached in memory on a **Least Recently Used (LRU)** basis, meaning older, unused batches are released to free memory.

### **Why Use `fetchBatchSize`?**

1. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Instead of loading the entire dataset, only a small subset is loaded at any given time.

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Reduces the overhead of managing large arrays and minimizes SQLite row cache usage.

3. **Better for Large Datasets**:
   - Ideal for scenarios like table or collection views where users interact with only a subset of data at a time.

---

### **Combining with `returnsObjectsAsFaults`**
- Setting `returnsObjectsAsFaults = false` works well with `fetchBatchSize` because:
  - Only a small batch of objects is fetched, so the memory impact of fully materialized objects is limited.
  - The full data is often needed immediately (e.g., for populating a UI component like a table view).

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- `fetchBatchSize` is an efficient way to handle large datasets by fetching data in smaller, manageable chunks.
- It reduces memory usage and optimizes performance by loading only the data you need when you need it.
- Used in conjunction with `returnsObjectsAsFaults`, it ensures your app remains responsive even with very large data sets.

This approach makes it possible to build scalable and performant apps that interact with extensive Core Data stores.
