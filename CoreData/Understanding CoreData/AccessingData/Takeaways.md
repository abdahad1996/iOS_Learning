### Core Data: Efficient Memory Management with Large Datasets

---

#### **Summary**

Core Data provides mechanisms to efficiently manage large datasets while keeping memory usage low. It achieves this by retaining only the currently required parts of the object graph in memory. Key features like **object and relationship faults** and **batched fetch requests** enable this memory-efficient approach.

Core Data’s **multilayered architecture** ensures performance and memory tradeoffs:
- **Registered objects**: Fastest to work with but have the highest memory impact.
- **Row cache**: Stores data in a more memory-efficient way but requires more processing.
- **Fetch requests**: Always query the underlying SQLite database, making them the most expensive but ensuring up-to-date data.

For large datasets, using features like **dictionary result types** can leverage SQLite’s power for aggregate calculations without pulling entire objects into memory.

#### **Takeaways**

- **Fetch Requests**:
  - Always perform a round trip to the database, retrieve data into the row cache, and return object faults by default.

- **Object Faults**:
  - Lightweight placeholders for objects. Accessing a property on a fault triggers **fault fulfillment** to retrieve its data.
  - Fault fulfillment is relatively cheap if the data is in the row cache; otherwise, it requires a database fetch, which can be expensive for frequent or individual object queries.

- **Fetch Request Options**:
  - Fetch requests offer control over:
    - Returning results as faults.
    - Loading actual attribute data.
    - Other optimizations based on use case.

- **Batch Fetching**:
  - Use the `fetchBatchSize` property to avoid loading data for all rows at once. If you don’t need all results immediately, this property is essential for memory efficiency.

- **Relationship Reference Cycles**:
  - Accessing relationships from both sides (e.g., `Country -> Mood` and `Mood -> Country`) creates a **reference cycle**.
  - Break the cycle by refreshing at least one of the objects involved using `context.refresh(object, mergeChanges: true)` at appropriate points in your app's lifecycle.

By leveraging these Core Data features and best practices, you can handle large datasets effectively, optimize memory usage, and maintain app performance.
